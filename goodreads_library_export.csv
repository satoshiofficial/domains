7445,The Glass Castle,Jeannette Walls,"Walls, Jeannette",,"=""074324754X""","=""9780743247542""",5,4.32,Scribner,Paperback,288,2006,2005,2011/09/03,2011/08/30,,,read,"This is a sad, hurtful, yearning, ever-hopeful, page-turning story that in its own way is truly a gem. With that said, I want to get one thing straight: not a single page went by that I did not want to slap the living hell out of Jeannette's mom. Not in a hurtful way, not in a Neanderthal way, but in a way that can only be universally understood as what-the-HELL-are-you-doing-you-idiot.<br/><br/>To get one more thing out the way, if you enjoy one of the following then this book's right up your alley:<br/><br/>(1) Vignettes of a grown woman lounging around all day, saying pseudo-intellectual one-liners, over, and over.<br/>(2) Homelessness fueled mostly in part by the aforementioned.<br/>(3) The complete nonexistence of instinctual child rearing skills.<br/>(4) Borderline adult craziness (or, disassociation with damn near everything modern).<br/>(5) The sneaking (and eating) of food when your kids are four feet away, starving.<br/><br/>Real foundations for a good memoir, if you ask me.<br/><br/>One of the first things you'll notice when you start to read this is the way everything is plainly-spoken and spelled out in simple language. Walls is no McCarthy or DFW. But don't fret, this is done on purpose. In this case the actions and scenes are the main drive, the real page-turner, and also the sparse-but-hard-hitting conversation (kind of like Raymond Carver does in all his short stories).<br/><br/>Jeannette and her sister and brother (and soon after her much-younger other sister) face what probably only 2% of the population haveto face, in terms of complete and total dishevelment and depravity almost as soon as they left the womb. Their dad is a whiz at physics and calculations, and their mother is a self-proclaimed artist and writer--and their both crazy; but not totally crazy, only in a slight sense, kind of like a rogue hippy, or how pudding develops a hard layer atop its sweet interior, dooming them to forever live life as nomads and wanderers while still retaining mass amounts of knowledge and wonder (it's enough to make you want to slap them at times, though, and grab them by the shoulders and shake some sense into them).<br/><br/>I really won't get into detail in this summary, partly because I don't feel like it, but I will say that Jeannette and her siblings did an extraordinary job of making it through all the extreme hardships they faced (and, trust me, there were plenty).<br/><br/>This book did something to me: it cemented a sort of idea that nothing in my life is as bad as it seems, and I can get through it, and that I can keep on getting through it, because nothing that has happened to me can shake a stick at what Jeannette's been through.",,,1,0

(And I'm glad I picked one written by Brian Wood, whom I've come to find out is a big name in comics these days, for obvious reasons. -- If I'm not mistaken Mr. Wood took a year out of his life to study up on the entire history of the area written about, and the people in it.)<br/><br/>This is a story about a deadly plague during 1020 A.D. in a remote Russian town/village, and its subsequent effect(s) on and the unraveling of the normal social system. It follows a freshly-widowed mother and her only daughter, trying to survive alone in a small house in the middle of a town that's slowly deteriorating around them. The mother's husband used to be on the town council, and had a vote in things, but after he perished it's up to her to take his place.<br/><br/>And that's where things begin. (Trust me there's no spoilers here; just general info.) No one respects her. There's a guy named Boris who's kind of an evil Fonzi of the place, always saying tough guy things and getting in people's faces -- and oh yeah, killing a bunch of people as well, while also amassing a squad of goons to go along with whatever he says.<br/><br/>I got the single editions, so this wasn't a straightforward read like everyone else who presumably got the collected graphic novel, but even so, at the end of every issue I found myself looking ever more forward to the next.<br/><br/>And the ending is a pretty swell one.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good story, and good artwork along with it. (I give it five stars because, at this point in time, with my limited comics experience, I don't know if this is really as good as it seems when stacked up to all the rest, or the 'usual good comics story,' but that's all I have to go off of. Still, I'd recommend it to anyone.)",,,1,0
